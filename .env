# Environment variables for the log search project

# Base URL for API calls
# In a real project, this would point to the actual API server.
# For now, we're using mock data, so this isn't used, but it's good practice to have it.
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://llm-trace-store.onrender.com/api/v1/

# This project doesn't require any sensitive API keys or secrets for its mock setup.
# However, in a real-world scenario, you might have something like this:
# REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
